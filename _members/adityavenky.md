### Story: 

I had near zero exposure to Tech, or coding or electronics when I first came to Kumarans in 11th grade. I knew I had interest in 'making' things because I used to tinker around with my Mechanix kit as a kid and did some carpentry over summer. Mostly used to complain about the unavailability of resources whenever I started on something. Made me give up on many, many things
Basically, like any 16 year old, I had ideas but no direction.
Owing to the fact that we liked learning more than what was there in the curriculum, Gautam Padiyar and I teamed up and we started work on what came to be our 12th grade CS project : Bash for Windows.
We also worked on other side projects and learnt a whole lot of stuff along the way.
Inspired by Adhesh Shenoy and Aabharan Hemanth, I started learning about and experimenting with electronics and electrical equipments, no matter how low I was, on resources.
Essentially, my peer group pushed me to do better things.

### Achievements :
